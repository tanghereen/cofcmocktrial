Thank you for your gift. Your generosity has the power to make an impact by ensuring that funds are available to retain, support, and educate students in pre-law studies.

<h2>Fundraising</h2>
<p>We have multiple fundraising events throughout the school year. In the past we have had Percent Nights at Off-Track Ice Cream and Chipotle on King St. All you have to do is let your cashier know you'd like to donate some of the proceeds of your order to the Mock Trial Club. 
    
    Stay tuned on our Instagram to keep up with announcements about these events.</p>
