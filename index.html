<h2>What is the Mock Trial Club?</h2>
    <p>College of Charlestonâ€™s Mock Trial Club is a student-led, student-run organization with cooperation from the Political Science department that focuses on the practice and implementation of trial advocacy skills. We hope to fill gaps in the existing curriculum regarding lawful practices and deliberation, all while preparing members for real-world scenarios and allowing for sharing of experiences and local expertise.</p>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Our club meets each week in order to develop our skills, knowledge and understanding of the many different aspects of law, ranging from simpler topics such as <b>civil procedure and judicial functions</b> to more complex topics such as <b>criminal procedure, direct and cross examinations, input of evidence, and extensive trial procedure</b>. 
        <br>We hope by covering a wide range of topics within the field of law we can cultivate the skills of our members who are all considering applying to law school and are dedicated to learning all the ins and outs of the procedural system.</p>
<br>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>We will meet at ...<br>
        <b>Rita Liddy Hollings Center<br>
         ROOM 103<br>
         Mondays at 7PM</b> <br>
        for the Fall 2022 semester.</p>

    Competing in these competitions provides extremely valuable experience that is recognized in the industry. Many of our members have competed in high school, and can attribute job offers, interviews, and experience they have received directly to their participation in these competitions.
    <br>
    Anyone, regardless of experience, is encouraged to participate!</p>
